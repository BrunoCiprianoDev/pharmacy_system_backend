<p>The Pharmacy system is a web project built on the REST architecture that uses the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) protocol to allow 
communication between different applications and services over the internet. A Rest API is a set of standards and guidelines that define how the 
resources (data and functionalities) of a web system should be exposed and accessed by other applications. These resources are usually represented 
by URLs (Uniform Resource Locator), and HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE are used to access and manipulate these resources.Therefore, just like most projects built based on this type of architecture, it is divided into Frontend (https://github.com/BrunoCiprianoDev/pharmacy-system-frontend) and Backend (contained in this repository).</p>
